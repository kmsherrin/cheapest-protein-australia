Whey protein is a type of protein that is derived from cow's milk. It is a **complete protein**, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that the human body needs but cannot produce on its own. It is also rich in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which are **important for muscle building and repair**.

There are two main types of whey protein take for sports supplementation. Whey protein concentrate (WPC) and whey protein isolate (WPI). Both types are commonly used, but there are some key differences between the two.

## Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC)

Whey protein concentrate is made by separating the proteins from the liquid part of milk (whey). It contains a higher percentage of protein (usually around 80%) and a lower percentage of fat and lactose compared to whole milk.

One of the main benefits of whey protein concentrate is that it is less expensive to produce than whey protein isolate. This is because it requires less processing, but that does leave the final product with a higher percentage of other milk components such as lactose and fat. The small amount of fats can assist in muscle building and general bulking if you are not trying looking to limit your fat intake.

As WPC does include some additional fats, it tends be a much creamier product, typically tasting much better than WPI. This creaminess also translates into the mixibility of the protein, with WPC producing a thicker shake than WPI (this is particularly noticable when mixed with water).

Whey protein concentrate is also a good source of immune-supporting compounds such as lactoferrin and immunoglobulins. These compounds may have a positive impact on immune function and may help to reduce the risk of infections.

## Whey Protein Isolate (WPI)

Whey protein isolate is made through a more intensive filtration process that removes most of the fat, lactose, and other milk components from the final product. As a result, whey protein isolate has a higher protein content (usually around 90%) and is lower in fat and lactose compared to whey protein concentrate. This is preferred if you are trying to build muscle but also want to limit your intake of fats.

One of the main benefits of whey protein isolate is that it is easier to digest and may be suitable for individuals who are lactose intolerant. It is also a good option for those who want to limit their intake of fat and lactose.

However, it is worth noting that the filtration process used to produce whey protein isolate may also remove some of the immune-supporting compounds found in whey protein concentrate. The removal of pretty much all fats means the final product is also much less creamy than whey protein concentrate, which can make it a less enjoyable product to consume.

## Nutritional Breakdown

These are _typical_ values that you can expect from most products.

| Source                | Protein (g) | Fat (g) | Carbohydrate (g) | Kilojoules (kJ) | Cost (per 100g) | Protein Value (g/$) |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| WPI (100g)            | 88          | 1       | 2.5              | 1600            | $4.50           | 19.5                |
| WPC (100g)            | 77          | 6       | 8.5              | 1650            | $3.50           | 22                  |
| Glass of Milk (500mL) | 18          | 19.5    | 20               | 1350            | $1.50           | 12                  |
| Steak (100g)          | 25          | 19      | 0                | 1200            | $3.00           | 8.3                 |
| Soybeans (100g)       | 18.5        | 9       | 8.5              | 720             | $0.75           | 24                  |

I input a glass of milk as 500mL as a protein shake would be close to 500mL. The price of the steak could fluctuate depending on the cut of steak, but for reference I pointed to a rump.

## Key Takeaways

Whey protein concentrate and whey protein isolate are both high-quality sources of protein that can be used in sports nutrition and supplements. However, there are some key differences between the two, including their protein content, cost, and the overall taste.

Whey protein concentrate has a lower protein content (usually around 80%) but is less expensive to produce and contains immune-supporting compounds such as lactoferrin and immunoglobulins. Go for this as a general protein and you are not too concerned about maintaining an absolutely shredded physique.

Whey protein isolate has a higher protein content (usually around 90%) and is easier to digest, but it is more expensive to produce and may lack some of the immune-supporting compounds found in whey protein concentrate. This is your go-to if you are looking to keep a lean physique while still getting enough protein for muscle building and repair.

When choosing between the two, it is important to consider your individual needs and goals. Both types of whey protein can be useful for muscle building and repair, but the right choice will depend on your specific needs and preferences.
